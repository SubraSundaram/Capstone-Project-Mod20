Capstone project Exploratory Data analysis
# Identifying the customers/prospects who will opt out of a marketing campaign.

## Question
Predict who among the prospects will "opt out" of a marketing campaign.

## Data Source
This data is being provided by a client of ours, who has given us permission to use the data for our project.


## Rationale for doing an analysis of the "Opt out" + "Prospects" data
An email is sent or an approach is made via social media to a prospect from this Organization to encourage engagement. If the Prospect decides to "Opt Out" of the campaign that negatively affects the standing of the Org with Google and other Social media platforms. Hence prediction who won't opt out is very useful to them.


## Personal goal for this Capstone project:
By creating a robust prediction model, I hope to showcase my abilities to analyze data and make prediction for real-world customers. 


## Data Processing done so far:
1) Out of the original 138 features, we have identified 38 columns that have useful data. 
2) The Null values in the categorical features, among the chosen 38 features, have been replaced with the string "NoneSelected".
3) Out of the chosen 38 features, about 15 features were chosen for preliminary analysis of the data. Rest of the features will be included at a later stage.
4) Data pre-processing was done with one-hot encoding for categorical features.


## Next steps
After consulting with the Learning Facilitator for Section C, Ms,Matilde D'Amelio, these are the improvements on the analysis that I am planning:
1) Do oversampling as the data is highly unbalanced.
2) Use Bayesian Optimization as that is ideal for such a problem.
